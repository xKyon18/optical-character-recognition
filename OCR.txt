This application leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict handwritten digits drawn by the user on an interactive canvas. 
Users can draw a number (from 0 to 9) on the canvas, and the CNN model processes the input image in real-time. After submitting the drawing, 
the app converts the canvas into a format suitable for prediction, rescaling and preprocessing the image before passing it through the trained CNN. T
he model then analyzes the features of the drawing—such as edges, shapes, and textures—through its multiple convolutional layers and predicts the number.

Key functionalities of the app include:

Interactive Drawing Canvas: Users can freely draw numbers using a brush tool, simulating the input for handwritten digit recognition.

Real-Time Prediction: Upon submission, the drawing is processed and a prediction is made by the CNN, displaying the result instantly.

Clear and Reset Option: Users can clear the canvas to draw new numbers or restart the process.

Training and Accuracy: The app also has functionality for training the model and displaying prediction accuracy.

This app demonstrates the practical use of neural networks in handwriting recognition, a field with real-world applications such as 
digitizing handwritten content, check processing, and form data extraction.
